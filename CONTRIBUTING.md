### File Naming Conventions

- **C/C++**: `q[NUMBER]_descriptive_name.c` or `.cpp`
  - Example: `q15_leap_year.c`
- **Python**: `q[NUMBER]_descriptive_name.py`
  - Example: `q15_leap_year.py`
- **Java**: `Q[NUMBER]DescriptiveName.java` (PascalCase)
  - Example: `Q15LeapYear.java`
- **JavaScript**: `q[NUMBER]_descriptive_name.js`
  - Example: `q15_leap_year.js`

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Add a header comment with:
  ```

  // Description: [Brief description of the problem]
  // Language: [Programming Language]
  ```

### Language-Specific Standards

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Add docstrings for functions

#### C/C++
- Use proper indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab)
